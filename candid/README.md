Got it! Here's a clear, simple README snippet that explains those commands and how to use them in your DBank project context:

## Getting Canister IDs and Accessing the App

When you deploy your canisters using DFX, each canister is assigned a unique **Canister ID**. You need these IDs to interact with your canisters through URLs or from your frontend code.

### 1. Get the Canister ID for the Candid UI

This command prints the canister ID of the special Candid UI canister (a built-in tool to interactively explore your canister's interface):

```bash
dfx canister id __Candid_UI
```

You can open this ID in your browser to explore the Candid interface of any deployed canister.

### 2. Get the Canister ID of Your DBank Canister

Replace `dbank` with your canister name if different:

```bash
dfx canister id dbank
```

This command prints the unique Canister ID for your DBank canister.

### 3. Access Your Application in the Browser

Use the following URL format to open your app running on the local Internet Computer replica:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=<asset_canister_id>&id=<candid_ui_canister_id>
```

For example:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai&id=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
```

* Replace `r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai` with your DBank canister ID.
* Replace `rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai` with your Candid UI canister ID.

This URL will open the ICP replica and load your canister with access to its Candid UI for inspection and interaction.
